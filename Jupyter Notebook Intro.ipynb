    "The best way to think of these cells and the way they're being output to the notebook is to imagine that the script and the terminal window have been combined. Whereas a script would normally execute entirely and output to a separate window we can see what's going to the terminal at what point within our code which can help us identify where the code is having issues. For this to work well it is important to split the code across multiple cells, as each cell is run as its own discrete piece of the whole. For example run the following cell:"
